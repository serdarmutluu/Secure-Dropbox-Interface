# Encrytion Layer for Dropbox

An encryption layer for the files that we send to Dropbox and we read from Dropbox using Dropbox Java SDK.

Built with the purpose of getting familiar with Dropbox API and securing confidential information by using symmetric encryption.
To make it more secure asymmetric encryption can be implemented.
